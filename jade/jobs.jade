    | projects the applicant for this role must be known as a leader in this space who is often
    | consulted on how to best optimize crowdsourcing efforts, as well as how to avoid mistakes and
    | pitfalls. As a prerequisite for this role, applicants must be able to provide concrete
    | examples of what they have accomplished via past crowdsourcing projects, with specific
    | performance measurements. This role requires a passion for online activism, a strong desire
    | to rebalance the world's power structure, and an exceptional work ethic. This role requires a
    | minimum commitment of 5 hours per week (15 preferred) for a minimum timeframe of six
    | months.
